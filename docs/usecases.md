# Usecases

## Batteries included - with access to schema

User of the library has GraphQL endpoint and access to the schema with
directives itself. Think of schema from `gql` tag. Forms have to be
automatically generated, meaning all the user needs to do is run schema generate
and then just include reuquired tags and generated files where needed. This
gives form and it's validation out of the box.
